#### Activity Recognition with Deep Learning

WISDM v1.1 Activity Prediction Dataset \[1] \[2]: http://www.cis.fordham.edu/wisdm/dataset.php

Jupyter notebooks can be run directly provided dependencies are installed. All experiment material is included in various subdirectories as detailed below:

#### data
   - `cleaned_WISDM_v1 `

    Contains cleaned data as generated by DataUnderstanding.ipynb
#### logs

        Contains logs from experiments. Both per epoch and evaluation results were recorded for each.
#### model_training_scripts
   - `best_cnn3_all_conv_5_fold.py`
   - `best_cnn3_all_conv_hybrid_5_fold.py`
   - `best_cnn3_all_conv_lstm3_5_fold.py`
   - `best_cnn3_all_conv_lstm3_hybrid_5_fold.py`

    Scripts for each model used in experiments. Scripts perform 5 fold cross validation. For information on motivation for using particular architectures and hyperparameters see [3][4].

#### src

  - `utils.py`

        Necessary functions for model scripts.


  - `reporting.py`

        Code for plotting confusion matrix


#### tests

  - `test_utils.py`

        Unit tests for utils class


`CNN_LSTM_WISDM.ipynb`

    Loads and runs final CNN-LSTM models on impersonal data.

`CNN_LSTM_WISDM_Hybrid.ipynb`

    Loads and runs final CNN-LSTM models on hybrid data.

`CNN_WISDM.ipynb`

    Loads and runs final CNN models on impersonal data.

`CNN_WISDM_Hybrid.ipynb`

    Loads and runs final CNN models on hybrid data.

`DataUnderstanding.ipynb`

    Downloads data, shows various attributes of data and displays entire data preparation process. Exports cleaned_data into data directory.

## Dependences
**Note:** Older/newer packages may work but this cannot be gauranteed:
* Python==3.5.4
* pandas==0.20.3
* numpy==1.13.3
* Keras==2.1.2
* tensorflow==1.4.1
* scikit-image==0.13.0
* scikit-learn==0.19.0
* matplotlib==2.0.2.
* jupyter==1.0.0


** For DataUnderstanding.ipynb wget is required to download dataset should it be required.
